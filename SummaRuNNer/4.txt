US President-elect Joe Biden on Monday unveiled his economic team, nominating Janet Yellen, former Federal Reserve chair, to lead the Treasury Department.
If confirmed by the Senate, Yellen would be the first woman to serve as US treasury secretary in the department's 231 years of history. She would also be the first person to have served as treasury secretary, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, and chair of the Federal Reserve.
The president-elect also selected Wally Adeyemo, president of the Obama Foundation, as deputy secretary of the Treasury.
If confirmed, Adeyemo would be the first Black deputy secretary of the Treasury.
Biden also selected Neera Tanden, who currently serves as president and CEO of the Center for American Progress, as director of the Office of Management and Budget, and named Cecilia Rouse, dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
